# StackStorm Community Signup Serverless Service

> This time, with [Serverless framework](https://serverless.com)

This is a 'take two' on [Slack Signup with AWS Lambda](https://github.com/dzimine/slack-signup-lambda).
It was simple and functional, but working with AWS raw is such a pain in the butt...

Here, I use 1) [serverless.com](https://serverless.com) to make working with lambda enjoyable and 2) AWS step-functions
for multi-step sign-up workflow that touches multiple services.


### Install, configure, deploy, test
